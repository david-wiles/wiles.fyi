    ðŸ‘‹ Hi! This is my blog.
  </h1>

  <p>
    I'm a full-stack software developer who works on websites. I'm passionate about programming and love to learn about
    all things software. My other passions involve classical music, lifting, and Tarantino movies.

    I'm also a graduate student researching serverless computing. I've recently finished a proof-of-concept serverless
    platform using Docker to run serverless applications in containers from pre-built images. You can find the code at
    <a href="https://github.com/david-wiles/container-paas">github.com/david-wiles/container-paas</a>.
