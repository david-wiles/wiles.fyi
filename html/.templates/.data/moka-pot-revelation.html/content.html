  Occasionally, you realize that everything you've read and heard about was wrong. You come to question everything
  you know about something, and you'll never again think the same way again. That is what happened when I first tried
  coffee out of a Moka Pot
</p>

<p>
  I may be slightly exaggerating, but I do think the moka pot has a bad rep in 'third wave' coffee that it doesn't
  deserve. If you read about coffee brewing methods, the one that is least recommended is always the moka pot. You'll
  read that it will give you bitter coffee, that you'll be wasting your expensive coffee beans with an inferior brewing
  method. I've found that this is not true at all, and the coffee from a moka pot is nearly as good as espresso for
  certain coffees.
</p>

<p>
  A moka pot may not be the most precise method, but it is certainly a tasty one. Like espresso, the coffee is not
  filtered by paper, but instead with a metal basket (which means its really unfiltered, like the french press). This
  gives the coffee it produces a rich body, and since the brewing ratio is much lower it will seem closer to espresso
  than brewed coffee.
</p>

<p>
  Brewing with a moka pot may be less popular with coffee enthusiasts because there are fewer variables to mess around
  with. The only one that should really be changed is the grind size. The ones that you could change but probably
  shouldn't are the burner temperature and the brew ratio. This makes for a less interactive experience than with a
  pourover, but pourover coffee can get old every morning. With a moka pot, you simply put the coffee in and let it
  boil.
</p>

<p>
  My process is slightly more complicated than that, but not by much:
</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    Boil water
  </li>
  <li>
    Put coffee in the basket
  </li>
  <li>
    Brew until the spout starts bubbling
  </li>
</ol>

<p>
  Clearly, the moka pot isn't very interactive. However, it can be fun to watch!
</p>

<p>
  Although the coffee out of a moka pot isn't really espresso, it also isn't really regular, brewed coffee. And that's
  what I like about it. In my opinion, brewing darker coffees roasted with an espresso style will taste better out of
  a moka pot than with any other non-espresso brewing method. The moka pot is another tool in the coffee brewer's
  and it's a tool that I think is used less often that it should be.
