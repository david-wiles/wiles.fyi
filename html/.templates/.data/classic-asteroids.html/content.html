<p>One of first hits of the arcade era was Atari’s Asteroids. I would be willing to bet that anyone who has played video
    games has played a version of this game at some point; it is up there with Space Invaders as one of the most well
    known games of all time. For this reason, I’ve decided to remake it in a web-based version.</p>

<p>You can play the game here: <a href="/asteroids.html">https://david.wiles.fyi/asteroids.html</a>. The arrow keys control the spaceship, f to shoot and s for shield.</p>

<p>I’ll make another post in the future describing my implementation in depth, but for the present, you can find the
    repository on github here: <a href="https://github.com/david-wiles/asteroids-ts">https://github.com/david-wiles/asteroids-ts</a>.</p>
