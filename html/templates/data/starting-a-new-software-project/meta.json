  "preview": "The phrase “writer’s block” is used to describe the feeling of getting stuck when starting a new project. Although the true meaning of writer’s block is closer to a years-long “creative drought” almost everyone has this shared experience and developers are no different.  Making progress on a new project can be a slow and tedious process, especially for inexperienced programmers.
